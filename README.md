# Programming Development
  This is a 100% academic and study repository for my codes. I'll use this as a main resource to store and study various programming languages. Besides that, I'll probably use this as a curriculum addition.

# Who can use this?
  Anyone can use any code that you find here, but, if you're using it as a educational, academic or professional means, please, give the right credits. Don't try to steal the codes, and don't use it as a monetizing plataform.

# Who am I?
  I'm just a IT student that likes a lot to program and learn, I search for self-development and intelectual improvement.
